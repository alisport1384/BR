/**
 * Calculates routing share and the independent identity/IP owner for the two physical paths.
 *
 * User scores are authoritative for routing whenever they differ. Observed quality may only
 * influence the routing split when the user gives both paths the same score.
 *
 * Identity/IP selection is intentionally independent from routing share, and is sticky: once a
 * path owns identity, it keeps it regardless of score/latency until it is the one that actually
 * goes down - at which point the other path takes over immediately and becomes sticky in turn.
 * The very first assignment (only, before any handoff has ever happened) is decided by: the
 * higher user score if scores differ, or whichever path shows the better latency during the
 * first ~5 seconds of monitoring if scores are equal. See preferredIdentityPath for the full
 * state machine.

     *    on a monitoring window meant only for comparing two healthy paths). This ALSO updates

     *    reinstated - identity stays on whichever path just carried the traffic during the
     *    outage until that one itself goes down.
     *  - Both paths up, an owner is already assigned -> sticky: keep it regardless of
     *    score/latency. The owner only ever changes via the single-path branch above, i.e.
     *    only by actually going down - never by the other path merely "looking better".
     *  - Both paths up, no owner yet (first-ever decision, or both were down and both just came
     *    back simultaneously) -> gated by ~5 seconds of real monitoring (samples.size reaching
     *    MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_DECISION, matching the probe loop's ~1s cadence) so the very first
     *    pick is not made on zero information. Unequal scores: the higher score wins outright.
     *    Equal scores: whichever path had the better (lower) median latency during that
     *    monitoring window wins.
     *
     * Routing weights are never changed by this method.
