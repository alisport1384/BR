     * them to silently fail until each one's own idle timeout, and steer future sessions
     * to the surviving path via the same migration NetworkSessionTracker already uses
     * for hard losses. Call this on the ok -> not-ok transition only, not on every failed
     * probe, so a still-genuinely-lost network (already handled by updateNetworks) isn't
     * evicted twice, and so recovered-then-flaky paths aren't churned every cycle.
