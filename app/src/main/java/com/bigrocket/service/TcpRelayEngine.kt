 * on the TUN device, this engine performs a minimal but correct handshake (SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK)
 * before relaying payload bytes, keeps sequence/ack numbers consistent in both directions, chunks
 * outgoing data to fit the interface MTU, and paces writes to never exceed the client's
 * advertised receive window.
 *
 * Because the TUN device is a purely local, in-order, lossless link, respecting the client's
 * window is sufficient to prevent stalls - there is no real network loss to recover from, so no
 * retransmission queue is needed as long as we never overrun what the client says it can buffer.
 *
 * This is still not a full TCP implementation (no reordering or congestion control), but it is
 * enough for typical request/response and bulk-download flows such as HTTP(S).
